# KLogger

Small (Windows) keylogger written in c# (.NET).

It is based on two GitHub repositories:
* keyboardlistener.cs by akimsko https://gist.github.com/akimsko/2011327#file-keyboardlistener-cs
* Keylogger by BlackVikingPro https://github.com/BlackVikingPro/Keylogger/blob/master/Keylogger/Program.cs

## What it does?

It captures keyboard keys into file `info.log` on temp folder.

It is not meant to be very hidden or something like that. It is useful for experimenting or something like that.
